### Example Usage

In the HashiCups menu you can find a Packer Spiced Latter (id 1) with **40ml** of espresso (id 1) and **300ml** of semi skimmed milk (id 2).
Let's pretend you want to customized it to have **50ml** of espresso and **200ml** of semi skimmed milk instead. Also, you would like
to order two of that.
Your packer configuration will be:

```hcl
source "hashicups-order" "my-custom-order" {
  username = "education"
  password = "test123"

  item {
    coffee {
      id = 1
      name = "My Custom Packer Spiced Latter"
      ingredient {
        id = 1
        quantity = 50
      }
      ingredient {
        id = 2
        quantity = 200
      }
    }
    quantity = 2
  }
}

build {
  sources = ["sources.hashicups-order.my-custom-order"]
}
```
