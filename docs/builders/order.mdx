# Order

Type: `order`

The order builder is used to create used to create custom HashiCups order. A custom order is when you want to change
an ingredient quantity from one of the original coffees from the Hashicups menu. See [Example Usage](#example-usage) to
understand better how it works.

- `password` (string) - The password signed up to the Product API.
- `item` ([]OrderItem) - An item you would like to order. See the [order item configuration](#order-item-configuration).

### Optional

- `host` (string) - The Product API host. Defaults to `localhost:19090`

## Order item configuration

### Required

- `coffee` ([]Coffee) - The item's coffee. See the [coffee configuration](#coffee-configuration).


### Optional

- `quantity` (int) - How many of the item you would like to order. Defaults to `1`.

## Coffee configuration

### Required

- `id` (string) - The id of the coffee you would like to customize. The ID should exist in the Hashicups menu.
- `name` (string) - The name of your customization. Should be different from the original coffee's name.
- `ingredient` ([]Ingredient) - The ingredients you'd like to change the quantity of.
See the [ingredient configuration](#ingredient-configuration).

## Ingredient configuration

### Required

- `id` (string) - The id of the coffee ingredient you would like to customize. The ID should exist in the Hashicups menu.
- `quantity` (int) - The new quantity amount you'd like your coffee to have from the ingredient.


### Example Usage

In the Hashicups menu you can find a Packer Spiced Latter (id 1) with **40ml** of espresso (id 1) and **300ml** of semi skimmed milk (id 2).
Let's pretend you want to customized it to have **50ml** of espresso and **200ml** of semi skimmed milk instead. Also, you would like
to order two of that.
Your packer configuration will be:

```hcl
source "hashicups-order" "my-custom-order" {
  username = "education"
  password = "test123"

  item {
    coffee {
      id = 1
      name = "My Custom Packer Spiced Latter"
      ingredient {
        id = 1
        quantity = 50
      }
      ingredient {
        id = 2
        quantity = 200
      }
    }
    quantity = 2
  }
}

build {
  sources = ["sources.hashicups-order.my-custom-order"]
}
```
